🎬 Movie Success Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This project aims to predict movie success categories based on IMDb scores using machine learning models. By analyzing key movie attributes, we build predictive models to assist industry decision-makers in assessing a film's potential success.

📊 Dataset
We used a dataset sourced from The Movie Database (TMDb) via Kaggle. It contains essential movie details such as:

Titles, ratings, release date, runtime, budget, popularity, original language, director, cast, writers, IMDb score, and revenue
The target variable is derived from IMDb scores:
Flop: 1-3
Avg: 3-6
Hit: 6-10

⚙️ Methodology
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns
Applied data preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance model performance
Trained multiple machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost (achieved 82.9% accuracy)

🚀 Results
XGBoost outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy of 82.9% in predicting movie success categories.
